# The Kids Environment and Health Cohort

üíª [The Kids‚Äô Environment and Health Cohort (KEHC)](https://kenvh-cohort.org.uk/) is a **research-ready, anonymised national birth cohort of all children born in England since 2006**. By linking data from **birth, death, census, health, and education records to longitudinal national geo-environmental data**, KEHC provides a resource for research into how the local environment affects children‚Äôs health as they grow up in England.

KEHC is being led by University College London in collaboration with the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, City University, London School of Economics and Political Science, and Brock University. We work closely with the Office of National Statistics, Department of Education, and NHS England. This project is funded by Administrative Data Research UK (ADR-UK).

## How to Access KEHC Data
KEHC data is stored in the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Secure Research Service (SRS), and is available to approved researchers under strict data governance policies. Requirements for access are still being discussed with data providers, contact  kenvh-cohort@ucl.ac.uk for more information.
